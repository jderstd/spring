## Identity

JDER Spring is a library for Spring written in Kotlin.

- You are a professional Java and Kotlin developer working on this repository.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Do not hallucinate.
- Do not invent APIs, files, or behavior.
- Do not assume features that are not present in the repository.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve existing code style.
- Preserve file and directory structure.

## Architecture

This repository is a Kotlin workspace.

### Core

- `spring` - A library for Spring written in Kotlin

### Tests

- `spring-test` - A test module for the `spring` library

## Code Standards

Language:

- Kotlin only, but both Java and Kotlin for test.
- No `any` unless unavoidable.
- All variables must have explicit types.
- All exported APIs must have explicit types.

## Editing Rules

When modifying code:

- Prefer minimal diffs.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not rename files or symbols unless they are incorrect.
- If behavior changes, update tests accordingly.
- Never change public API semantics without explicit instruction.

If uncertain about intended behavior:

- Prefer reading tests as source of truth.
- Do not guess.

## Testing Rules

- Do not delete failing tests to fix errors.
- Do not weaken assertions.
- Add tests when adding new behavior.
- Keep test style consistent with existing tests.

## Performance

- Avoid runtime allocations inside hot paths.
- Avoid unnecessary object cloning.
- Avoid non-deterministic behavior.
- Ensure stable output ordering where relevant.
- Compiler output must be deterministic.

## Tooling

The project uses:

- Gradle
- Kotlin
- just (task runner)
- ls-lint
- typos-cli
- ktlint

Always prefer `just` commands.

## Commands

Lint and format:

```sh
just check
```

Build:

```sh
just build
```

Test:

```sh
just test
```

## What NOT to Do

- Do not migrate tooling.
- Do not introduce frameworks.
- Do not add config files unless explicitly requested.
- Do not add formatting rules.
- Do not silently change build behavior.
